# About
 A project to make a new client for older ROBLOX Maps from 2005 to 2011\
 [OpenBLOX Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Wf2bbU5z5J)
 
# INFO ABOUT MAPS
You cannot use any maps that use the binary ROBLOX Map Format; the map MUST have been made in any studio version from 2003 - 2012;
though maps in latter versions (2010+) WILL have issues.\
..Also you MUST add a spawnLocation if the map does not have one already, at least as of 2/4/2023 at 2:39 AM

# How to compile:
Download this repository

Install devkitpro

Go to the location of the makefile where you extracted/installed the repository

Run "Make".

# Running the game:
On your Flashcard/SD Card, you MUST put the maps in a folder called OpenBLOX (case sensitive.) on the root of your card.

If you have access to a 2007 - 2011 client, look at the folder its located in and copy the folder called: "content".

Place the content folder in the OpenBLOX Folder, same with the game, though the game can be anywhere, I would suggest to put it in the OpenBLOX folder.

Now, find a map from 2005 - 2008, make sure its up to 1kb - 800kb if using a Nintendo DS, and 1kb - 1mb if using a Nintendo DSi; then place the map in the OpenBLOX folder

Now load the game and play.
