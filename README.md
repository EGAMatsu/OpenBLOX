# About
A project to make a new client for older ROBLOX Maps from 2005 to 2011

And to make programs/games that can play ROBLOX Maps, aka something like a game in Unity that can play old ROBLOX games, or UE5

Or even to make maps playable in places like VRChat.

Pretty much, we want to make it so people know how the game works and to make their own ports of ROBLOX maps/ROBLOX itself.

# INFO ABOUT MAPS
You cannot use any maps that use the binary ROBLOX Map Format; the map MUST have been made in any studio version from 2003 - 2012;
though maps in latter versions (2010+) WILL have issues.\
..Also you MUST add a spawnLocation if the map does not have one already, at least as of 2/4/2023 at 2:39 AM

# How to compile for DS/i:
[Install devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

Clone/Download this repository

Extract it in a desired location if you downloaded it

Go to Platforms->NDS then run Make.

# Running the game on DS/i:
On your Flashcard/SD Card, you MUST put the maps in a folder called OpenBLOX (case sensitive.) on the root of your card.

If you have access to a 2007 - 2011 client, look at the folder its located in and copy the folder called: "content".

Place the content folder in the OpenBLOX Folder.

For the game, put it in the root of your SD Card.

Now, find a map from 2005 - 2008, make sure its up to 1kb - 800kb if using a Nintendo DS, and 1kb - 1mb if using a Nintendo DSi; then place the map in the OpenBLOX folder.

Now load the game and play.
