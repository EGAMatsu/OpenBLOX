# Running the game:
On your system/SD Card, put the .nds file either on root or its own folder.

If you have access to a 2007 - 2011 client, look at the folder its located in and copy the folder called: "Content".

Place the content folder in the same folder as the .nds file.

Now, find a map from 2005 - 2008, make sure its up to 1kb - 800kb if using a Nintendo DS, and 1kb - 1mb if using a Nintendo DSi.

Copy the map in the folder as the .nds and rename it to: "map.rbxl".

Now load the game and play.
